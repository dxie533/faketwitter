TODO List:
- Reformat all of the warm up project paths to fit our new fake twitter clone endpoints.
- Basic UI for the functionality.
- Probably setup a RabbitMQ queue for handling mail and then adding a microservice to handle sending mail
- Maybe consider setting up a separate microservice for the database.
